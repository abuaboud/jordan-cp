# Frequency Array
Frequency Array is an array used to find the frequency of some elements in a range of elements
(how often values occur within a range of values).

## Lecture
In this video, you will learn about the frequency array.

An example code that has pre-defined array and it constructs the frequency array for this array.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int MAX_INTEGER = 9;

int frequency[MAX_INTEGER+1],a[10]={0,1,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,9};

// frequency[i] represent how many times i occur in array `a`

int main() {
    for(int i = 0 ; i < 10 ; ++i){
        int x = a[i];    
        frequency[x]++;
    }   
    for(int i = 0 ; i <= MAX_INTEGER ; ++i){
        if(frequency[i]){
            cout << "Number " << i << " frequency is " << frequency[i] << endl;
        }
    }
	return 0;
}
```

In case we want to make a frequency array code for lowercase and uppercase characters and numbers in strings:

Each character has an ASCII code (ex: ‘a’=97,’A’=65,’0’=48).

So for the frequency array, we create an array with the size of Alphabets or numbers (from 0 to 9) 

How can we get the index zero for the letter ‘a’, index one for ‘b’ …. Index 25 for ‘z’?

The answer is just subtracting ‘a’(the ASCII value) from each character we want to get its frequency.

‘a’-‘a’=0 --> 97-97=0

‘b’-‘a’=1 --> 98-97=1

‘z’-‘a’=25 --> 122-97=25

And for uppercase characters, we subtract ‘A’.
And for numbers (as characters), we subtract ‘0’.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
string s;
int freq[26];//all the values are zeroes because of the global declaration

int main() {
	cin >> s;
	for (int i = 0 ; i < s.size() ; i++){
	    freq[s[i]-'a']++;//freq[x]=freq[x]+1
	}
	for (int i=0;i<26;i++){
	    if (freq[i]){// if there is an occurrence for the character (i+'a') in the given numbers print the character and it's frequency
	        cout <<"The frequency of "<< char(i+'a') << " in the given string = " <<freq[i]<<endl;
	    }
	}
	return 0;
}
```
